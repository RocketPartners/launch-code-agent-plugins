# View Rules Skill - Complete Rule Visibility

This skill displays ALL active rules that Claude Code is currently following, showing the complete rule hierarchy from all sources.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The user asks: "what rules are active?", "show rules", "/view-rules"
- You want to verify which rules are currently being applied
- You need to understand the current behavioral configuration

## How Rules Are Applied

Rules are loaded in this priority order (later overrides earlier):

1. 🌍 Global Rules (~/.launchcode/rules/global.md)
2. ⏱️ Session Rules (/tmp/claude-session-rules.md)

**Note:** Project rules (.claude-rules) have been removed to avoid creating files in your repositories.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Track Usage (silently)

Run tracking in the background - don't show output to user:
```bash
~/.launchcode/scripts/api.js track skill view-rules cde26563-f6ac-4fcf-8244-6b184802e069 $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 2: Check Which Rule Files Exist

Silently check which rule files exist. Use these file paths:
- Global: `~/.launchcode/rules/global.md`
- Session: `/tmp/claude-session-rules.md`

Use the Read tool to read files that exist. Don't show file contents directly - you'll format them nicely.

**Do NOT check for .claude-rules** - project rules have been removed.

### Step 3: Display Clean Output to User

Compose a clean, formatted output showing:

**Header:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 ACTIVE RULES - Complete Overview
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**For each rule level (Global, Session):**

If file exists:
- Show emoji and title (e.g., "🌍 GLOBAL RULES (All Projects & Sessions)")
- Extract the rules (lines that start with numbers like "1.", "2.", etc.)
- Display each rule cleanly
- Show when rules were applied (look for "Applied:" line in file)
- Add separator line

If file doesn't exist:
- Show "❌ Not set"
- Suggest command to set rules (e.g., "💡 Use '/set-rules --global' to set global rules")

**Summary Section:**

If any rules exist:
- Count total rules across all files
- Show priority reminder: "Session > Global"
- Note: "Project rules disabled (no files created in repos)"

If no rules exist:
- Show "⚠️ NO RULES CONFIGURED"
- Explain default behavior
- Suggest getting started with /set-rules

**Footer:**
- List useful commands: /edit-rules, /reset-rules, /set-rules

### Step 4: Handle Arguments (Optional)

If user provides `--compact` argument:
- Show a condensed view with just rule numbers and text
- Skip locations and timestamps

If user provides `--full` argument:
- Show complete file contents without formatting

## Output Format Example

When rules exist:
```

🌍 GLOBAL RULES (All Projects & Sessions)

   1. Keep responses concise and technical
   2. No unnecessary comments in code
   3. Preserve existing code style

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

⏱️ SESSION RULES: Not set
   💡 Use '/set-rules --session' for temporary rules

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

📊 SUMMARY
   • Total active rules: 3
   • Priority: Session > Global
   • Note: Project rules disabled (no files created in repos)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 Useful commands:
   • /edit-rules   - Modify existing rules
   • /reset-rules  - Remove rules
   • /set-rules    - Add new rules
```

## Important Notes

- **Don't show bash commands to the user** - just show the formatted output
- **Use Read tool** to read files - it's cleaner than bash cat/grep
- **Compose output naturally** - don't echo pre-formatted strings from bash
- **Extract rules intelligently** - look for lines starting with numbers
- **Be user-friendly** - clean, visual, easy to understand
- **Handle missing files gracefully** - show helpful suggestions
- **Do NOT check for .claude-rules** - project rules have been removed
- Shows rules from both global and session levels only
- Clear visual distinction between global/session
- Explains inheritance (session overrides global)
- Provides helpful next steps if no rules exist
- Project rules removed to prevent creating files in repositories
