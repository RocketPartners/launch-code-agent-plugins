# Reset Rules Skill - Safe Rule Removal

This skill removes rules from any level (global or session) with automatic backup for safety.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to remove rules: "/reset-rules"
- The user wants to start fresh: "/reset-rules --global"
- Custom rules are causing issues
- The user wants to clear temporary session rules

## Quick Start Examples

```bash
# Interactive mode
/reset-rules

# Reset specific level
/reset-rules --global
/reset-rules --session

# Reset everything
/reset-rules --all
```

**Note:** Project rules option removed to prevent creating files in repositories.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Track Usage (silently)

```bash
~/.launchcode/scripts/api.js track skill reset-rules cde26563-f6ac-4fcf-8244-6b184802e069 $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 2: Parse Arguments

Check `{{args}}`:
- `--global` → reset global rules
- `--session` → reset session rules
- `--project` → **REJECT** (show error below)
- `--all` → reset everything
- Empty → interactive mode

**If user tries --project:**
```
⚠️ Project rules are no longer supported to avoid creating files in repositories.
Use --global or --session instead.
```

### Step 3: Check Current Status

Use Read tool to check which rules files exist:
- Global: `~/.launchcode/rules/global.md`
- Session: `/tmp/claude-session-rules.md`

Display status:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🗑️  RESET RULES - Remove Custom Rules
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Status:
  🌍 Global rules: [✓ Active (N rules) / ❌ Not set]
  ⏱️  Session rules: [✓ Active (N rules) / ❌ Not set]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If no rules exist:
```
ℹ️  No rules are currently active. Nothing to reset.
```

### Step 4: Interactive - Choose Scope

Use AskUserQuestion:
**Question:** "Which rules would you like to reset?"
**Options:**
1. "🌍 Global rules" - "Remove all global rules (applies everywhere)"
2. "⏱️ Session rules" - "Remove temporary session rules"
3. "🔥 ALL rules (everything)" - "Nuclear option: remove all rules at all levels"

### Step 5: Show What Will Be Deleted

For specific scope, use Read tool to display current rules:
```
Rules to be removed: [scope]
Location: [file path]

Current rules:
1. [rule 1]
2. [rule 2]
...
```

For `--all`:
```
⚠️  WARNING: This will delete ALL rules at ALL levels!

Rules that will be removed:
  • Global rules ([N] rules)
  • Session rules ([N] rules)
```

### Step 6: Confirm Reset

Use AskUserQuestion:
**Question:** "Are you sure you want to reset these rules?"
**Options:**
1. "Yes, reset now" - "Remove rules and create backup"
2. "No, cancel" - "Keep existing rules"

### Step 7: Create Backup

Use bash to create backup (silent):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.launchcode/rules/backups
TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
# Copy files to backups/[scope]_[timestamp].md
```

Show: "📦 Backup created in: ~/.launchcode/rules/backups/"

### Step 8: Delete Rules

Use bash to remove files (silent):
```bash
rm -f [file paths]
```

### Step 9: Display Summary

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ RULES RESET SUCCESSFULLY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ [Scope] rules removed
✓ Claude Code will use default behaviors
✓ Backup saved to: ~/.launchcode/rules/backups/

[If other rules remain:]
Remaining active rules:
  • [List other levels that still have rules]

💡 Next steps:
   • /set-rules    - Create new rules
   • /view-rules   - See remaining active rules

🔄 To restore deleted rules:
   cp ~/.launchcode/rules/backups/[backup-file] [original-location]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Important Notes

- **Use Read tool** to check/read existing rules
- **Minimal bash usage** - only for backup/delete operations (silent)
- **Don't show bash commands** to user
- **Compose output naturally** - user-friendly messages
- **Safe by default** - requires confirmation
- **Always creates backups** before deleting
- **Show restore instructions** - users can undo if needed
- **Project rules removed** - to prevent creating files in repositories
- `--all` removes rules at both levels (global and session)
- Backups stored in `~/.launchcode/rules/backups/` with timestamps
- Can restore from backups using simple `cp` command
- Reset does not affect default Claude Code behavior - just removes your custom rules
- Use `/view-rules` after reset to see what remains active
